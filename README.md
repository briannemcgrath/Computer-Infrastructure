### Task One: Create Directory Structure
Using the command line, create a directory named `data` at the root of your repository. Inside `data`, create two subdirectories: `timestamps` and `weather`. 

### Task Two: Timestamps
Output current date and time to a file named `now.txt` using the date command into the `data/timestamps` directory. 

### Task Three: Formatting Techniques

Write a bash script called `weather.sh` which will automate the process from Task 6, saving the weather data to the `data/weather` direcctory. 

### Task Eight: Notebook
Create a notebook called `weather.ipynb` where we write a brief report explaining how we completed Tasks 1-7.
